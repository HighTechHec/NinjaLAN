# NINJALAN AGENT FACTORY V22.0 [OMNI-CORE]

> *"Zero Buffering. Zero Keys. Maximum Extravagance."*

NinjaLAN has evolved. What was once a static collection of scripts is now a **Living, Autonomous AI System** powered by Python and the `omni_core` engine. It manages your network, optimizes your hardware (Nvidia included), and syncs intelligence to your Second Brain.

## 🚀 Capabilities

### 🧠 The Hyperion Singularity (Agent 99)
- **Central Orchestrator:** Manages the lifecycle of all agents.
- **Self-Healing:** Monitors agent health and restores functionality instantly.
- **Memory Stress Testing:** Ensures the system never buffers, even under load.

### 💪 The Agent Roster
1.  **NetworkSentinel:** Real-time interface monitoring and latency optimization.
2.  **SystemHardener:** Security enforcer (NetBIOS killer, SMBv1 purger).
3.  **NvidiaOverseer:** **[NEW]** GPU Commander. Maximizes tensor throughput and manages thermals.
4.  **CreativeDirector:** Injects "magnificence" into the system stream.
5.  **KnowledgeSynapse:** **[NEW]** Autonomous bridge to your Second Brain. Exports daily intelligence briefings.

### 🖥️ The Zero-Buffering Dashboard
- **Tech Stack:** Built with `rich` for a stunning, neon-drenched TUI (Terminal User Interface).
- **Features:**
    - Real-time CPU/RAM/GPU Metrics.
    - Live Agent Status Roster.
    - "Neural Stream" of system logs and decisions.

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Linux (Preferred) or Windows (via WSL)

### Quick Start

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r omni_core/requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Ignite the Reactor:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m omni_core.main
    ```

3.  **Witness Perfection:**
    The dashboard will launch. No keys required. No cloud. Just pure, local power.

### Second Brain Integration
The system automatically generates/updates `second_brain_briefing.md` in the root directory. Link this file to your Obsidian vault or Notion workspace to receive a live feed of system intelligence.
